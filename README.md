QuCAT: Quantum Circuit Analyzer Tool in Python
==============================================

Maintained by [Mario Gely](https://github.com/mgely)

QuCAT stands for Quantum Circuit Analyzer Tool. This open source python library provides standard analysis tools for superconducting electronic circuits, built around Josephson junctions.

QuCAT features an intuitive graphical or programmatical interface to create circuits, the ability to compute their Hamiltonian, and a set of complimentary functionalities such as calculating dissipation rates or visualizing current flows in the circuit. QuCAT currently supports quantization in the basis of normal modes.
