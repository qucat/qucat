Creating a circuit
******************

A quantum circuit can be built or created in two different ways:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
  
   Graphically <gui>
   Programmatically <network>

After creation, a number of functions are available to compute
relevant physical parameters, extract a Hamiltonian or visualize
the innerworkings of the circuit, see :ref:`circuit-functions`
