Commenting and docstrings 
=========================

Commenting your code should come in two flavors.

First are inline comments which explain what the code is doing, for example

.. literalinclude:: example_inline_comment.txt
   :language: python

the more of these, the better!

The second, and most important comments are docstrings.
These should describe *at least* what every function or class does, what parameters it accepts and what it returns,
and *ideally* feature examples of typical use or some theoretical background.

This accomplishes two things:

-  The docstring can automatically be transformed to content for the QuCAT website
- It will appear to a user who requests help on a function (for example by using shift-tab in a jupyter notebook)

Docstrings should be formatted as `numpy style docstrings <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#id4>`_.
As an example, this docstring

.. literalinclude:: example_docstring.txt
   :language: python
    

Translates to the following website content
