Citing this project
*********************

As with anyone in academics, the life and death of QuCAT developpers is determined entirely by citations and paper count. 
Therefore, if you find QuCAT useful, please consider citing this project as:

Mario F. Gely and Gary A. Steele, QuCAT: Quantum Circuit Analyzer Tool in Python. Preprint at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10342.pdf (2019).

This will also help us secure future funding supporting the development of this software. 

A PDF version of this papers may be found on the ArXiv preprint server here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10342.pdf. 

If you do use QuCAT in a publication, please take a few minutes and let us know via email at mario.gely@qucat.org. 
We would love to hear how QuCAT is being used as a research tool.
