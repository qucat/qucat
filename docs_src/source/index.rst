QuCAT stands for Quantum Circuit Analyzer Tool.
This open source python library provides standard analysis
tools for superconducting electronic circuits, built around
Josephson junctions.

QuCAT features an intuitive graphical or
programmatical interface to create circuits, the ability to compute their Hamiltonian, and
a set of complimentary functionalities such as calculating dissipation rates or visualizing
current flows in the circuit. QuCAT currently supports quantization in the basis of
normal modes.
